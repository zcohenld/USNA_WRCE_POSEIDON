# Backup of USNA WRCE Filament Innovations Poseidon (Grogu)
Filament Innovations Poseidon 3D printer modified with two BigTreeTech Octopus Pro's and running Klipper firmware.

# 03/13/2024 Update
Finally got all the purchased parts in and printed and machined parts made. Everything is working well, just taking our time going through the setup process to make sure everything works perfectly and we dont crash anything. 

# 12/11/23 Update
The manufacturer packed the cable carriers with wires so that none of them could move or flex. So once we got it up and running a cable in one of the carriers broke. Instead of running a new cable and having the same issue happen later, we decided to redo the entire hotend and replace it with a Bigtreetech EBB42 CAN board, a Mosquito hotend, and a Bondtech extruder. This led to a complete redesign of the hotend mounting system as can be seen below. We're currently waiting on parts so the printer is down until they come in and we can assemble.
The hotend uses a heavily modified Petsfang Blokhead cooler, has a mount for the Klicky probe used for leveling, and has a mount for a nozzle camera and associated LEDs.
